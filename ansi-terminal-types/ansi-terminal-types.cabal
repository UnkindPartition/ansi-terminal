Synopsis:            Types and functions used to represent SGR aspects
Description:         The \'ANSI\' standards refer to the visual style of
                     displaying characters as their \'graphic rendition\'. The
                     \'ANSI\' codes to establish the graphic rendition for
                     subsequent text are referred to as SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION
                     (SGR). This package exposes modules that export types and
                     functions used to represent SGR aspects.
