-- | Provides ANSI terminal support for ANSI terminal software running on a
-- Unix-like operating system or on a Windows operating system (where supported)
-- or on other Windows operating systems where the terminal in use is not
-- ANSI-enabled.
--
-- The ANSI escape codes are described at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code>
-- and provide a rich range of functionality for terminal control, which
-- includes:
--
--  * Colored text output, with control over both foreground and background
--    colors
--
--  * Hiding or showing the cursor
--
--  * Moving the cursor around
--
--  * Clearing parts of the screen
--
-- The most frequently used parts of this ANSI command set are exposed with a
-- platform independent interface by this module.  Every function exported comes
-- in three flavours:
--
--  * Vanilla: has an @IO ()@ type and doesn't take a @Handle@.  This just
--    outputs the ANSI command directly on to the terminal corresponding to
--    stdout. Commands issued like this should work as you expect on both
--    Windows and Unix.
--
--  * Chocolate: has an @IO ()@ type but takes a @Handle@.  This outputs the
--    ANSI command on the terminal corresponding to the supplied handle.
--    Commands issued like this should also work as you expect on both Windows
--    and Unix.
--
--  * Strawberry: has a @String@ type and just consists of an escape code which
--    can be added to any other bit of text before being output. The use of
--    these codes is generally discouraged because they will not work on Windows
--    operating systems where the terminal in use is not ANSI-enabled (such as
--    those before Windows 10 Threshold 2). On versions of Windows where the
--    terminal in use is not ANSI-enabled, these codes will always be the empty
--    string, so it is possible to use them portably for e.g. coloring console
--    output on the understanding that you will only see colors if you are
--    running on an operating system that is Unix-like or is a version of
--    Windows where the terminal in use is ANSI-enabled.
--
-- Example:
--
-- > -- Set colors and write some text in those colors.
-- > sgrExample :: IO ()
-- > sgrExample = do
-- >     setSGR [SetColor Foreground Vivid Red]
-- >     setSGR [SetColor Background Vivid Blue]
-- >     putStr "Red-On-Blue"
-- >     setSGR [Reset]
-- >     putStr "White-On-Black"
