=============

A Haskell package providing support for 'ANSI' control character sequences for
terminals on Unix-like operating systems and Windows

Description
-----------

['ANSI' terminal escape code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_sequences)
support for Haskell, which allows:
-   Colored text output, with control over foreground, background and (where
    supported) underlining colors
-   Clearing parts of a line or the screen
-   Hiding or showing the cursor
-   Moving the cursor around
-   Reporting the position of the cursor
-   Scrolling the screen up or down
-   Switching between the Alternate and Normal Screen Buffers
-   Clickable hyperlinks to URIs
-   Changing the title of the terminal

[ansi-wl-pprint](http://github.com/batterseapower/ansi-wl-pprint), which
provides a pretty-printer that can construct strings containing 'ANSI'
colorisation.

Not all 'ANSI' escape codes are suported by this library but most (if not
all) of the popular ones that are well-supported by terminal software are,
including:
-   Select Graphic Rendition mode (colors and other attributes): `setSGR`
-   Clearing parts of the screen: `clearFromCursorToScreenEnd`,
    `clearFromCursorToScreenBeginning`, `clearScreen`,
    `clearFromCursorToLineEnd`, `clearFromCursorToLineBeginning` and
    `clearLine`
-   Cursor visibility changes: `hideCursor` and `showCursor`
-   Cursor movement by character: `cursorUp`, `cursorDown`, `cursorForward` and
    `cursorBackward`
-   Cursor movement by line: `cursorUpLine` and `cursorDownLine`
-   Directly changing cursor position: `setCursorColumn` and `setCursorPosition`
-   Saving, restoring and reporting cursor position: `saveCursor`,
    `restoreCursor` and `reportCursorPosition`
-   Scrolling the screen: `scrollPageUp` and `scrollPageDown`
-   Changing the title: `setTitle`

Each supported escape code or family of codes has a corresponding
function that comes in three variants:

-   A straight `IO` variant that doesn't take a `Handle` and just applies the
    escape code to `stdout` and any terminal attached to it
-   An `IO` variant similar to above, but which takes a `Handle` to which the
    escape code should be applied
-   A `String` variant that returns a literal string that should be
    included to get the effect of the code.

Example
-------

A full example is
[available](https://github.com/UnkindPartition/ansi-terminal/blob/master/ansi-terminal/app/Example.hs),
but for a taste of how the library works try the following code:

``` haskell
import System.Console.ANSI
import System.IO (stdout)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  stdoutSupportsANSI <- hNowSupportsANSI stdout
  if stdoutSupportsANSI
    then do
      setCursorPosition 5 0
      setTitle "ANSI Terminal Short Example"

      setSGR [ SetConsoleIntensity BoldIntensity
             , SetColor Foreground Vivid Red
             ]
      putStr "Hello"

      setSGR [ SetConsoleIntensity NormalIntensity
             , SetColor Foreground Vivid White
             , SetColor Background Dull Blue
             ]
      putStrLn "World!"
    else
      putStrLn "Standard output does not support 'ANSI' escape codes."
```
