{-# LANGUAGE Safe #-}

{-| == Introduction
Through this module, this library provides platform-independent support for
control character sequences following the \'ANSI\' standards (see further below)
for terminal software that supports those sequences, running on a Unix-like
operating system or on Windows (see further below).

The sequences of control characters (also referred to as \'escape\' sequences or
codes) provide a rich range of functionality for terminal control, which
includes:

 * Colored text output, with control over both foreground and background colors

 * Clearing parts of a line or the screen

 * Hiding or showing the cursor

 * Moving the cursor around

 * Reporting the position of the cursor

 * Scrolling the screen up or down

 * Switching between the Alternate and Normal Screen Buffers

 * Clickable hyperlinks to URIs

 * Changing the title of the terminal

A terminal that supports control character sequences acts on them when they
are flushed from the output buffer (with a newline character @\"\\n\"@ or, for
the standard output channel, @hFlush stdout@).

== \'ANSI\' standards
The \'ANSI\' standards refer to (1) standard ECMA-48 \`Control Functions for
Coded Character Sets\' (5th edition, 1991); (2) extensions in ITU-T
Recommendation (previously CCITT Recommendation) T.416 (03/93) \'Information
Technology â€“ Open Document Architecture (ODA) and Interchange Format: Character
Content Architectures\` (also published as ISO/IEC International Standard
8613-6); and (3) further extensions used by \'XTerm\', a terminal emulator for
the X Window System. The escape codes are described in a
  [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) and those
codes supported on current versions of Windows are descibed in
  [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences).

The whole of the \'ANSI\' standards are not supported by this library but most
(if not all) of the parts that are popular and well-supported by terminal
software are supported (see further below).

== Cursor positions
The functions moving the cursor to an absolute position are 0-based (the
top-left corner is considered to be at row 0 column 0) (see 'setCursorPosition')
and so is 'getCursorPosition'. The \'ANSI\' standards themselves are 1-based
(that is, the top-left corner is considered to be at row 1 column 1) and some
functions reporting the position of the cursor are too (see
'reportCursorPosition').

== Windows and control character sequences
The native terminal software on Windows has developed over time. Before
Windows 10 version 1511 (known as the \'November [2015] Update\' or
\'Threshold 2\') that software did not support control character sequences. From
2018, Microsoft introduced the Windows Pseudo Console (\'ConPTY\') API and then
Windows Terminal, with the objective of replacing most of the Windows Console
API with the use of control character sequences and retiring the historical
user-interface role of Windows Console Host (\'ConHost\').

Windows Terminal is supported on Windows 10 version 19041.0 or higher and
provided with Windows 11. It can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store. Windows
Terminal can be set as the default terminal application on Windows 10 (from
the 22H2 update) and is the default application on Windows 11 (from the 22H2
update).

Despite the above developments, some Windows users may continue to use ConHost.
ConHost does not enable the processing of \'ANSI\' control characters in output
by default. See 'hNowSupportsANSI' for a function that can try to enable such
processing.

Terminal software other than the native software exists for Windows. One example
is the \'mintty\' terminal emulator for \'Cygwin\', \'MSYS\' or \'MSYS2\', and
dervied projects, and for \'WSL\' (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

GHC's management of input and output (IO) on Windows has also developed over
time. If they are supported by the terminal software, some control character
sequences cause data to be emitted into the console input stream. For GHC's
historical and default IO manager, the function 'hGetBufNonBlocking' in module
"System.IO" does not work on Windows. This has been attributed to the lack of
non-blocking primatives in the operating system (see
  [GHC bug report #806](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/806). GHC's
native IO manager on Windows (\'WinIO\'), introduced as a preview in
  [GHC 9.0.1](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.0.1/docs/html/users_guide/9.0.1-notes.html#highlights),
has not yet provided a solution. On Windows, this library uses emulation based
on the Windows Console API to try to read data emitted into the console input
stream. Functions that use that emulation are not supported on consoles, such
as mintty, that are not based on that API.

== Function variants provided
Every function exported by this module comes in three variants, namely:

 * A variant that has an @IO ()@ type and doesn't take a @Handle@ (for example,
   @clearScreen :: IO ()@). This variant just outputs the \`ANSI\` command
   directly to the standard output channel ('stdout') and any terminal
   corresponding to it. Commands issued like this should work as you expect on
   both Unix-like operating systems and Windows (unless exceptions on Windows
   are stated).

 * An \'@h@...\' variant that has an @IO ()@ type but takes a @Handle@ (for
   example, @hClearScreen :: Handle -> IO ()@). This variant outputs the
   \`ANSI\` command to the supplied handle and any terminal corresponding to it.
   Commands issued like this should also work as you expect on both Unix-like
   operating systems and Windows (unless exceptions on Windows are stated).

 * A \'...@Code@\' variant that has a @String@ type (for example,
   @clearScreenCode :: String@). This variant outputs the sequence of control
   characters as a 'String', which can be added to any other bit of text before
   being output. If a high degree of backwards compatability is rewuired, the
   use of these codes is discouraged because they will not work on legacy
   versions of Windows where the terminal in use is not ANSI-enabled (see
   further above). On Windows, where emulation has been necessary, these
   variants will always output the empty string. That is done so that it is
   possible to use them portably; for example, coloring console output on the
   understanding that you will see colors only if you are running on a Unix-like
   operating system or a version of Windows where emulation has not been
   necessary. If the control characters are always required, see module
   "System.Console.ANSI.Codes".

== Examples of use

A simple example is below:

> module Main where
>
> import System.Console.ANSI
> import System.IO (stdout)
>
> -- Set colors and write some text in those colors.
> main :: IO ()
> main = do
>   stdoutSupportsANSI <- hNowSupportsANSI stdout
>   if stdoutSupportsANSI
>     then do
>       setSGR [SetColor Foreground Vivid Red]
>       setSGR [SetColor Background Vivid Blue]
>       putStrLn "Red-On-Blue"
>       setSGR [Reset]  -- Reset to default colour scheme
>       putStrLn "Default colors."
>     else
>       putStrLn "Standard output does not support 'ANSI' escape codes."

Another example is below:

> module Main where
>
> import System.IO (hFlush, stdout)
> import System.Console.ANSI
>
> main :: IO ()
> main = do
>   stdoutSupportsANSI <- hNowSupportsANSI stdout
>   if stdoutSupportsANSI
>     then do
>       setSGR [SetColor Foreground Dull Blue]
>       putStr "Enter your name: "
>       setSGR [SetColor Foreground Dull Yellow]
>       hFlush stdout  -- flush the output buffer before getLine
>       name <- getLine
>       setSGR [SetColor Foreground Dull Blue]
>       putStrLn $ "Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"
>       setSGR [Reset]  -- reset to default colour scheme
>     else
>       putStrLn "Standard output does not support 'ANSI' escape codes."
