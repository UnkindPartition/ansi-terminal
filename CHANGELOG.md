Changes
=======

Version 0.11.3
--------------

* Add `hyperlink`, `hyperlinkWithId` and `hyperlinkWithParams`, and support for
  clicable hyperlinks.

Version 0.11.2
--------------

* On Windows, fix compatability with the Windows I/O Manager (WinIO) when
  GHC >= 9.0.1 but `Win32` < 2.9.0.0.
* Improvements to Haddock documentation.

Version 0.11.1
--------------

* On Windows, fix compatability with the Windows I/O Manager (WinIO) introduced
  in GHC 9.0.1, by incorporating changes made in package `Win32-2.13.2.0` in
  that regard.
* Improvements to Haddock documentation.

Version 0.11
------------

* Remove deprecated `getCursorPosition0`. (Use `getCursorPosition` instead.)
* On Unix-like operating systems, the temporary turning off of echoing is moved
  from `getReportedCursorPosition` to `hGetCursorPositon`.
* On Unix-like operating systems, fix a bug in `getCursorPosition` and
  `hGetCursorPosition`, where the console input stream was was not always
  clear before the cursor position was emitted into it.

Version 0.10.3
--------------

* Add `getCursorPosition` as a synonym of `getCursorPosition0` and deprecate the
  latter.

Version 0.10.2
--------------

* `hGetTerminalSize` now assumes a terminal is no bigger than 9,999 by 9,999
  (previously, no bigger than 999 by 999).
* On Windows, fix a bug where emulated cursor movement functions differed from
  Windows 10 (movement bounded by the current viewport).

Version 0.10.1
--------------

* Add `hGetCursorPosition` and `hGetTerminalSize`.
* On Unix-like operating systems, fix a bug where `getReportedCursorPosition`
  could block indefinitely if no information was forthcoming on the console
  input stream.
* Improvements to Haddock documentation.

Version 0.10
------------

* Add support for setting the default color with new `SetDefaultColor`
  constructor of the `SGR` type.
* `getTerminalSize` now flushes the `stdout` channel, to ensure the cursor
  position is unaffected.

Version 0.9.1
-------------

* Flag modules with GHC's 'Safe Haskell' language extensions (from GHC 7.2.1).
* Improvements and corrections to Haddock documentation.

Version 0.9
-----------

* Add support for 256-color palettes with new `SetPaletteColor` constructor of
  the `SGR` type, and `xterm6LevelRGB`, `xterm24LevelGray` and `xtermSystem`.
* Remove deprecated `getCursorPosition`. (Use `getCursorPosition0` instead.)
* Add `hSupportsANSIColor`.
* Add `getTerminalSize`.
* Improvements to Haddock documentation.

Version 0.8.2
-------------

* Add `getCursorPosition0` and deprecate `getCursorPosition`. Any position
  provided by the latter is 1-based. Any position provided by the former is
  0-based, consistent with `setCursorColumn` and `setCursorPosition`.
* Improvements to Haddock documentation in respect of 0-based and 1-based
  cursor positions.

Version 0.8.1
-------------

* Add `hSupportsANSIWithoutEmulation`. On Windows 10, if the handle is
  identified as connected to a native terminal ('Command Prompt' or
  'PowerShell'), the processing of 'ANSI' control characters will be enabled.

Version 0.8.0.4
---------------

* On Windows, `hSupportsANSI` now recognises if the handle is connected to a
  'mintty' terminal.
* Drop support for GHC versions before GHC 7.0.1 (released November 2010)

Version 0.8.0.3
---------------

* On Windows, try to enable ANSI on ConHost terminals even if a TERM environment
  variable exits (such as with the Hyper 2 terminal)
* Minor improvements to Haddock documentation

Version 0.8.0.2
---------------

* Improve README and Haddock documentation
* On Windows, fix compatability with earlier GHC versions
* Drop support for GHC versions before 6.12.1 (released December 2009)

Version 0.8.0.1
---------------

* On Windows, if the standard output channel is valid but not a ConHost
  terminal, assume it is ANSI-enabled rather than failing
* On Windows, output the improved error message to the standard error channel
  rather than the standard output channel

Version 0.8
-----------

* Make the fields of `SGR` strict
* Make compatible with GHC 8.2.2
* Improve the error message on Windows when not ANSI-capable or ConHost
* Recognise Appveyor build environment as ANSI-enabled

Version 0.7.1.1
---------------

`getReportedCursorPosition`: don't let the cursor reporting code be echo'd

Version 0.7.1
-------------

* Allow saving, restoring, and querying the current cursor position
* Fix a couple of issues with the Reset emulation on Windows

Version 0.7
-----------

Add 24-bit RGB color support

Version 0.6.3.1
---------------

Fix Windows + ghc 7.8 compatibility

Version 0.6.3
-------------

* Add ANSI support for Windows
* Add compatibility with Win32-2.5.0.0 and above

Version 0.6.2.3
---------------

Add an example to the haddocks

Version 0.6.2.2
---------------

Version 0.6.2.1
---------------

Restore compatibility with GHC 7.4 and older

Version 0.6.2
-------------

* Add `hSupportsANSI`

Version 0.6.1.1
---------------

Fix to build with GHC 7.8 on Windows

Version 0.6.1
-------------

* `BoldIntensity` no longer changes background color on Windows
* `setSGR []` was not equivalent to `setSGR [Reset]` on Windows, even though it
  should be according to the documentation. This is now fixed.
