{-| The Win32 library ships with GHC. Win32-2.1 first shipped with GHC 6.6
(released October 2006). Win32-2.5.4.1 first shipped with GHC 8.2.1
(released July 2017), replacing Win32-2.3.1.1.

The ansi-terminal library makes use of functionality in Win32-2.1 and other
functionality first added to Win32-2.5.0.0 or Win32-2.5.1.0 (from ansi-terminal
itself).

This module provides functions available in those later versions of Win32 to a
wider range of compilers, reducing the use of CPP pragmas in other modules.

-- | This bit is all highly dubious. The problem is that we want to output ANSI
-- to arbitrary Handles rather than forcing people to use stdout.  However, the

-- This code accomplishes this, albeit at the cost of only being compatible with
