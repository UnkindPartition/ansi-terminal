-- that: (1) the handle is a terminal; and (2) a @TERM@
-- environment variable is not set to @dumb@ (which is what the GNU Emacs text
-- editor sets for its integrated terminal).
--
-- For Windows, the current implementation performs the same checks as for
-- Unix-like operating systems and, as an alternative, checks whether the
-- handle is connected to a \'mintty\' terminal. (That is because the function
-- 'hIsTerminalDevice' is used to check if the handle is a
-- terminal. However, where a non-native Windows terminal (such as \'mintty\')
-- is implemented using redirection, that function will not identify a
-- handle to the terminal as a terminal.) On Windows 10, if the handle is
-- identified as connected to a native terminal, this function does /not/ enable
-- the processing of \'ANSI\' control characters in output (see
-- 'hSupportsANSIWithoutEmulation').

-- | Use heuristics to determine whether a given handle will support \'ANSI\'
-- control characters in output. (On Windows versions before Windows 10, that
-- means \'support without emulation\'.)
--
-- If the handle is not writable (that is, it cannot manage output - see
-- 'hIsWritable'), then @return (Just False)@ is returned.
--
-- On Unix-like operating systems, with one exception, the function is
-- consistent with 'hSupportsANSI'. The exception is if the handle is not
-- writable.
--
-- On Windows, what is returned will depend on what the handle is connected to
-- and the version of the operating system. If the handle is identified as
-- connected to a \'mintty\' terminal, @return (Just True)@ is
-- returned. If it is identifed as connected to a native terminal, then, on
-- Windows 10, the processing of \'ANSI\' control characters will be enabled and
-- @return (Just True)@ returned; and, on versions of Windows before Windows 10,
-- @return (Just False)@ is returned. Otherwise, if a @TERM@ environment
-- variable is set to @dumb@, @return (Just False)@ is returned. In all other
-- cases of a writable handle, @return Nothing@ is returned; this indicates that
-- the heuristics cannot assist - the handle may be connected to a file or
-- to another type of terminal.
